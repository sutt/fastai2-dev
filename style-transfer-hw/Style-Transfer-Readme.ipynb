    "### Style Transfer Homework\n",
    "-----\n",
    "**Abstract:** Applying the results of the FastAI style lectures from [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXXiC4YRGrQ) and [Zach Mueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w3sEgqDvSo) with `fastai_v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "We build four style models (abstract, biggie, ink, watercolor) and apply each against four target contents. The two most artistically succesful images are:\n",
    " - biggie style applied to mountain\n",
    " - abstract style applied to cat\n",
    "\n",
    "| Original | Style | Modified |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|<img src=\"imgs/content4.jpg\" width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/style2.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/content4_style2.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|\n",
    "|<img src=\"imgs/content3.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/style3.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/content3_style3.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|\n",
    "|<img src=\"imgs/content1.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/style1.jpg\"  width=\"100px\"/>|<img src=\"imgs/content1_style1.jpg\" width=\"100px\"/>|\n",
    "\n",
    "Strange results with ink in the distortion of content faces. Perhaps the style network fails to recognize the style image as a face? It seems it definetly does not capture the style of \"messy pen\" and instead reverts to something like cubism with charcoal pencil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dissapointing results with watercolor, this points to watercolor not being captured well by this Graham matrix matching method. Another problem, the system relies on one color style too heavily. Surprisingly, applying a water color of a landcape as a style to a landscape photograph doesn't work well, while applying the the style of a \"hip hop\" painting does work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most intriguing result is the selective shading of African and Caucasian skin tone. \"Biggie\" style comes from a abstract painting of an black artist where the skin is stylized with deep blue tones. When applying this style to even a black and white photograph of an african (again, \"Biggie Smalls\") the deep blue is transfered to his face. Meanwhile for caucasian skin tone (pictured, Jeremy Howard) this style does not bestow any blue onto his skin. Caveats: \n",
    " - sample size greater than two needed, \n",
    " - need to test content photographs in both color and black&white\n",
    " - the abstract style also shades black faces with blue and white faces with orange\n",

    " \n",
    " - Why do we need to train a style model on all of image net?\n",

    " - What parameter controls the tradeoff in loss from style vs tradeoff in loss from content (like lambda in regression regularization).\n",

    " - Need to crop the original content images before.\n",
